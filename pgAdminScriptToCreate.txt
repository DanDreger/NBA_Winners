1. In PGAdmin 4, create a database called nba_stats

2. Then create a table called nba with the query tool with the following script:

CREATE TABLE nba (
	id int PRIMARY KEY,
	Team VARCHAR(4),
	PTS FLOAT,
	FG FLOAT,
	FGA FLOAT,
	Two_PA FLOAT,
	Three_P FLOAT,
	Three_PA FLOAT,
	eFG_Percentage FLOAT,
	Home_Away VARCHAR(6),
	ORtg FLOAT,
	FTr FLOAT,
	Three_PAr FLOAT,
	TS_Percentage FLOAT,
	FT_FGA FLOAT,
	ORtg_opponent FLOAT,
	FTr_opponent FLOAT,
	Three_PAr_opponent FLOAT,
	TS_Percentage_opponent FLOAT,
	eFG_Percentage_opponent FLOAT,
	FT_FGA_opponent FLOAT
	

);



3. Import season_team_averages.csv to pgadmin table
